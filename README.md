# Topic-Based-Sentiment-Detection
Developed an approach that given a sample identifies the topics along with their respective sentiments. 

The solution uses a Semi-Supervised Topic Modeling approach using Guided LDA (https://guidedlda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), followed by Multi-Class classification on Review-Topic pairs. Features used are GloVe embeddings and Topic Distributions on Review and Topic texts.
